# Blockchain

## Paradigms of Blockchain

There are two paradigms of blockchain:
- permissionless model
- permissioned model

## Permissioned Blockchain

- Hyperledger.
- B2B (Business to Business).
- make it easy to share trusted information in a secure context, and with the confidentiality that businesses need to operate effectively.
- the primary incentive of permissioned blockchain participants is to minimize the cost, time, and ease of sharing information.
